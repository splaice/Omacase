# Omacase

**Yes, this is what you think it is. Omarchy for MacOS, lol.**

An opinionated, tiling macOS — installed, configured, themed, and managed from a
single command. Omarchy's ethos (keyboard-first, one consistent theme everywhere,
one-command reproducible) translated to where macOS actually wants to go.

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/splaice/omacase/main/boot.sh)"
```

This installs Xcode CLT + Homebrew, clones to `~/.local/share/omacase`, and runs
`omacase install`. Then:

```bash
omacase doctor      # grant Accessibility to AeroSpace, SketchyBar, Karabiner
```

## The stack
| Layer | Pick |
|---|---|
| Window manager | **AeroSpace** (no SIP disable) — yabai available as advanced profile |
| Status bar | **SketchyBar** |
| Borders | **JankyBorders** |
| Launcher | **Spotlight** (built in — Tahoe actions, clipboard, Quick Keys) |
| Keyboard | **Karabiner-Elements** |
| Terminal | **Ghostty** + zsh/Starship + tmux + modern CLI set |
| Editor | **Neovim/LazyVim** + Zed |
| Packages | **Homebrew + Brewfile** |
| Dotfiles | **Omacase-owned symlinks** (`home/`) — won't collide with your own chezmoi/stow |
| Theme | **19 Omarchy themes** (Catppuccin Mocha default) — one command rethemes everything |

## Commands
```
OMACASE_DRYRUN=1 omacase install   # print every change without touching the system
omacase install            # idempotent full setup (re-runnable)
omacase update             # pull + brew bundle + re-apply everything
omacase theme [name]       # retheme everything: apps + macOS Light/Dark + wallpaper
omacase webapp [name]      # open an Omarchy web app (for a Spotlight Shortcut)
omacase appearance [...]   # toggle/set macOS Light/Dark (toggle|dark|light)
omacase launchers [...]    # build Spotlight "Oma …" launchers: web apps + workspaces (build|remove)
omacase wm aerospace|yabai # switch window-manager profile
omacase grid [1-9]         # toggle an AeroSpace workspace (default: focused) into a 2x2 grid
omacase workspace <1-9>    # switch AeroSpace workspace (alias: ws)
omacase doctor             # check perms, SIP, missing grants
omacase backup [label]     # snapshot current dotfiles & macOS defaults
omacase restore [id]       # roll back to a snapshot (--list to see them)
omacase menu               # gum TUI (wrap in a Shortcut to launch from Spotlight)
```

> **Reversible by design.** `install` auto-snapshots any pre-existing dotfiles
> and the macOS defaults domains it touches *before* changing anything. Don't
> like the result? `omacase restore` puts your old setup back. Omacase manages
> its own dotfiles as symlinks, so it never fights an existing chezmoi/stow.

> **One switch, themed everywhere.** `omacase theme <name>` repoints Ghostty,
> SketchyBar, JankyBorders, btop, Neovim, and Starship — and also flips macOS
> Light/Dark, the Claude Code CLI theme, and the desktop wallpaper to match.
> Pick from 19 Omarchy themes (run `omacase theme` to list).

> **Tab-complete everything.** `omacase <Tab>` completes subcommands, and the
> arguments complete from live data — theme names, web apps, snapshot IDs,
> `wm`/`appearance`/`launchers` options. The managed zshrc also switches on
> zsh's completion system itself (`compinit`), so git, brew, aerospace, and
> every Homebrew tool that ships completions Tab-complete too.

## Keybinds

Launcher — **Spotlight** (built in; no third-party launcher):
- `⌘ Space` — Spotlight: launcher / search / Actions / clipboard history (Tahoe)
- `⌃⌘ Space` — Emoji & Symbols (Character Viewer)
- `⌘ Tab` / AltTab — switch windows

> Nothing to configure — `⌘Space` is Spotlight by default. If a previous launcher
> took it, re-enable System Settings → Keyboard → Keyboard Shortcuts → Spotlight.

`omacase launchers` builds `.app` launchers (all prefixed **`Oma `**) so Spotlight
can open web apps and switch workspaces: type **`Oma`** to see them all — `Oma Mail`,
`Oma ChatGPT`, …, and `Oma 1`…`Oma 9` (switch to AeroSpace workspace N).

**Super** = **right ⌘**, remapped by Karabiner to `⌃⌥⌘`
(`home/dot_config/karabiner/karabiner.json`) — Hyper *minus* Shift, so `Super+Shift`
stays free as the "move" layer. It drives AeroSpace, mirroring Omarchy's `SUPER`.

### Super — AeroSpace tiling (Hyprland-style)

Terminal:
| Keys | Action |
|---|---|
| `Super + Return` | New Ghostty window |
| `Super + Shift + Return` | Ghostty into tmux (attaches/creates session `main`) |

Focus & move (WASD — W up, A left, S down, D right):
| Keys | Action |
|---|---|
| `Super + w / a / s / d` | Focus window up / left / down / right |
| `Super + Shift + w / a / s / d` | Move window up / left / down / right |
| `Super + Shift + ← / ↓ / ↑ / →` | Join window with neighbor into a nested container (compose 2×2 grids) |

Layout & size:
| Keys | Action |
|---|---|
| `Super + f` | Fullscreen toggle |
| `Super + = / -` | Grow / shrink focused window |
| `Super + e` | Tiles layout — flip split orientation (side-by-side ↔ stacked) |
| `Super + q` | Quad — toggle the workspace into / out of a 2×2 grid |
| `Super + z` | Accordion layout — focused window stays large, rest tuck aside |
| `Super + Shift + Space` | Float / unfloat the window |

Workspaces & monitors:
| Keys | Action |
|---|---|
| `Super + 1 … 9` | Switch to workspace N |
| `Super + Shift + 1 … 9` | Send focused window to workspace N |
| `Super + Tab` | Next workspace (wraps around) |
| `Super + Shift + Tab` | Previous workspace (wraps around) |

Config & service mode:
| Keys | Action |
|---|---|
| `Super + Shift + c` | Reload AeroSpace config |
| `Super + Shift + ;` | Enter service mode, then: `esc` reload · `r` reset tree · `f` float toggle · `backspace` close others · `tab` former workspace · `m` move workspace to next monitor |

## The two honest limits
1. **Permissions** (Accessibility/Input Monitoring) must be granted by hand — macOS
   requires it. `omacase doctor` links you straight there.
2. **yabai** needs SIP partially disabled (a manual Recovery step). The default
   **AeroSpace** profile needs none of that. Blur/window-animations are not possible
   on macOS regardless of WM — only borders.

## Managed by Claude
`skills/omacase/SKILL.md` teaches Claude to drive this CLI — so the same surface that
installs the system also lets an agent retheme, diagnose, and reconfigure it.

> Status: **0.1.0** — the CLI engine, AeroSpace (Super-key WASD tiling),
> SketchyBar, Ghostty, JankyBorders, the Karabiner Super key, Neovim/LazyVim, and
> all 19 Omarchy themes (terminal + bar + borders + btop + nvim + prompt) are real.
> Spotlight is the launcher (no setup — `⌘Space`); Raycast is no longer used.
